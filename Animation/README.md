### Julie's objects : 
### Sea Shell :

    Animation : 
    I created the animation in blender. To have this effect of opening and closing of shell, I came to put a keyframe at the initial position of my object, then I made a rotation of my shell from the top to simulate the opening and I made a new keyframe. So I have a shell that opens. And to close the shell I carried out the same process but by making a rotation in the opposite direction.
