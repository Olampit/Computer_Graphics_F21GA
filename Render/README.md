## Julie's objects : 
### Sea Shell :

    Reference : 
    I didn't use a reference for this sea shell. I tried to reproduce my hand drawn sketch as best I could

    Modelling : 
    I started by taking two cylinders which represent the top and bottom of the shell of my sea shell and I scaled these cylinders to make them like flat discs. After that I applied a surface subdivision to refine them even more. Then to have a wavy appearance on my shell I went into edit mode. I selected one point out of two that I came to raise upwards with the transform tool and the others I brought them down which allowed me to obtain these undulations. I then created two other cylinders that I also flattened with the scale and with the bevel I rounded them a little to form the two small pieces behind the shell. And finally I simply created a sphere and I came the scale so that it could fit between my two pieces of shell.
    
    Materials : 
    
### Rock with reefs : 

    Reference :
        I didnâ€™t use a reference for this object either.

    Modelling :
        Rock-> I started with a cube, added extra faces, and then extruded them to create a shape resembling a sea rock. I also used the bevel tool on some edges to make the rock look more natural.
        Algae-> I started with a cube, added a subdivision modifier, and set the viewport level to 3 to make it look like a sphere. Then, I extruded some faces to create the algae.
        Reefs-> I started with cylinders of different sizes and placed them together. I created faces on top of each cylinder and extruded them to form the holes of each reef.
        Anemones-> I started with a circle, scaled its face to shape it like a dune. Then, I added a particle system in hair mode and adjusted the parameters to achieve the final result.
    
    Materials : 
        I used an image texture for the rock, and in Edit Mode, I selected the edges where I wanted the image to be cut, to get a more natural stone look.
        For the corals and anemones, I added a gradient along with a color ramp, which allowed me to choose the gradient colors.
        For the algae, I simply added an RGB color.
