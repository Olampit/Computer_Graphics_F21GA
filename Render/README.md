### Julie's objects : 
### Sea Shell :

    Reference : 
    I didn't use a reference for this sea shell. I tried to reproduce my hand drawn sketch as best I could

    Modelling : 
    I started by taking two cylinders which represent the top and bottom of the shell of my sea shell and I scaled these cylinders to make them like flat discs. After that I applied a surface subdivision to refine them even more. Then to have a wavy appearance on my shell I went into edit mode. I selected one point out of two that I came to raise upwards with the transform tool and the others I brought them down which allowed me to obtain these undulations. I then created two other cylinders that I also flattened with the scale and with the bevel I rounded them a little to form the two small pieces behind the shell. And finally I simply created a sphere and I came the scale so that it could fit between my two pieces of shell.
